# Certipop

Certipop empowers users to create verifiable proof of payments on Solana.

This is a single page dapp for interacting with the certipop proof of payment program. 

The transaction reference field in the certipop form offers an almost unopiniated way to add a reference to the proof of payment: i.e. purchase order number, invoice number, quote number and any other arbitrary trasnaction that needs verifiable proof.

## Getting Started

First, install required libraries:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
